Cosmic-Grid---Less
==================

Grid systems have gotten really crazy. Some do super awesome stuff and solve every problem you will ever need. I find myself using a similar system over and over again, but I had to manually figure out the numbers to get everything responsive. So I decided to use the power of the preprocessor LESS and make everything programatic as possible. 

To check out a working example, check out my code pen. http://codepen.io/jermbo/pen/sGxty?editors=110
